# Color Wars 🎮

**Color Wars** is a turn-based strategy game built with Python and Pygame.
Players place colored dots on a 5×5 board, trigger chain explosions, and convert enemy territory.
The project features both local PvP and PvE (vs AI) with three difficulty levels.

## 🎯 Game Overview

### Core Mechanics
- **Turn-based tactical gameplay** on a 5×5 board  
- **Chain-reaction explosion system** when cells reach 4 dots  
- **Territory conversion** after explosions: neighbors become your color  
- **Two game modes**: PvP (human vs human) or PvE (human vs AI)  
- **Three AI difficulties**: Easy (training-friendly), Medium (shallow lookahead), Hard (alpha-beta pruning)

### Win Condition
A player wins by:
1. Dominating the entire board, **OR**
2. Eliminating the opponent (reducing their cells to 0 after they had played)

### Dot Increment Rules
- **Empty cell capture**: +3 dots  
- **Reinforce owned cell**: +1 dot  
- **Explosion threshold**: 4 dots per cell (triggers cascade)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Pygame 2.5.0+

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Game
```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:PYTHONPATH='.'; pytest -v

# Linux/macOS
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -v
```

## 🎮 Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Left Click** | Place/reinforce on valid cell |
| **M** | Toggle between PvP / PvE mode |
| **R** | Restart current match |
| **F11** | Toggle fullscreen |

## ⚙️ Settings

The settings panel currently focuses on audio and can be expanded later for more match or display options.

- **Sound enabled**: pause or resume background music.
- **Volume**: reduce or increase the music level in real time.
- Changes apply immediately in-game and carry over from the Home screen into the next match.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- **Engine** (`rules.py`, `explosion.py`): Pure game logic, no side effects  
- **Controller** (`controller.py`): Orchestrates moves, updates state  
- **View** (`src/view/`): Rendering only, no game logic  
- **AI** (`src/ai/`): Decision-making, uses only engine & rules  

### Scalability
- **BaseScene & SceneController**: Enables new menus/scenes without code duplication  
- **UI Components** (`Button`, `Panel`, `TextLabel`): Reusable across all scenes  
- **Shared Constants & Layout**: Consistent theming and responsive geometry  

### Testing
- **Organized by module**: Easy to find and add tests  
- **Engine heavily tested**: Rules engine is the source of truth  
- **Integration optional**: View & AI can be tested independently  

## 🤖 AI Levels

### Easy (~20% win rate vs Medium)
- Picks mostly weak moves for learning-friendly gameplay  
- 80% probability of selecting suboptimal moves  
- Safe for first-time players

### Medium (~50% win rate vs Hard)  
- Shallow lookahead (1-2 plys)  
- Controlled randomness to avoid perfect play  
- Good for intermediate players

### Hard (~80% win rate vs Medium)  
- Alpha-beta pruning with evaluation function  
- Adapts to game state  
- Challenges experienced players

Run `scripts/benchmark_ai.py` to verify balance:
```bash
python scripts/benchmark_ai.py --games 200
```

## 📋 Development Notes

- **Rendering loop runs at 60 FPS** with responsive window resizing  
- **AI runs on main thread** (blocking during turn); optimize if needed for multiplayer  
- **No external assets required** (pure Pygame drawing)  
- **Snake_case** for functions, CamelCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants  
- **Gameplay HUD** now shows a chess-style win-rate meter on the right and recent moves in the lower-left  
- **Audio** uses the first MP3 under `asset/mp3/` as looping background music  
- **Difficulty** is selected from the Home screen slider before starting a bot match

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- See `requirements.txt` for runtime dependency installation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Game

```bash
python -m src.main
```

Home menu is shown first to choose game mode and (for bot mode) difficulty.

## Controls

- Left Click: place/reinforce on a valid cell.
- `M`: toggle `PVP` / `PVBOT`.

- `F11`: toggle fullscreen.

Note: Difficulty is selected from the Home screen before starting a bot match.

## Testing (Optional)

```bash
# On Windows PowerShell
$env:PYTHONPATH='.'; pytest -q
```

## Notes

- The runtime dependency is intentionally minimal for straightforward setup and play.
- AI and game rules share the same engine logic to keep behavior consistent.
